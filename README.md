Following along with the Odin Project to get sick Web Dev skills

This is just a simple project to get me used to the HTML boilerplate and
the basic workflow when it comes to developing a website. (I hope) 

Involves purely HTML and nothing else, and doesn't expand super far into it. The

Commits may be too much or heavy but I want to get accustomed to git, so it is
what it is. Good Project for beginners to follow along, like me.
