    <p>
        There is something about these chocolate chip pancakes that just reminds you of childhood. Itâ€™s an easy, gooey meal that can be topped with whatever you like. When served warm, the chocolate chips melt in your mouth. 

        This recipe for chocolate chip pancakes is pretty straight-forward. The recipe includes milk and white vinegar, which you combine at the beginning to sour the milk, creating something similar to buttermilk. 
        
        Along with the milk mixture, the batter is also made from all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda, eggs, salt, butter, vanilla, and mini chocolate chips. Depending on the sugar content of the chocolate you buy, chocolate will generally be a little bittersweet.
        
        You should definitely top the pancake with a generous slice of butter, as you would any pancake. Maple syrup pairs well with chocolate, but if you are looking to add other topping or ingredients, a little whipped cream works well, as do bananas, fresh berries in the spring, or a cinnamon in the fall.
